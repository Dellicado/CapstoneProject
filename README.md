# GlucoPulse: A Non-Invasive Glucometer 

## 🩺 GlucoPulse: A Non-Invasive Glucometer
GlucoPulse is a next-generation, Arduino-based glucometer engineered for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. Built around the powerful ESP32 microcontroller, it seamlessly integrates hardware, cloud connectivity, and intelligent prediction models to deliver a user-friendly and data-driven health solution.
## 🔧 Core Features:

 - Non-Invasive Sensing: Utilizes the MAX30102 pulse oximeter to capture photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals, enabling glucose estimation through light-based analysis—no needles required.
  
 - ESP32-Powered Architecture: Acts as the central CPU, orchestrating sensor data acquisition, preprocessing, and wireless communication with high efficiency.
  
 - OLED Display Interface: Provides real-time feedback and intuitive visualization of glucose readings directly on-device, enhancing usability and accessibility.
  
 - IoT Integration with Google Firebase: Enables secure cloud syncing, remote monitoring, and historical data tracking for both users and healthcare providers.
  
 - 📱 Mobile Application: A companion app offers personalized insights, trend analysis, and seamless interaction with the device—bridging hardware and user experience.
  
-  🤖 Machine Learning Intelligence: Trained on a curated dataset using polynomial regression, the system adapts to individual physiological patterns for increasingly accurate predictions over time.

## 🔬 Applications

Perfect for diabetic patients seeking a pain-free monitoring solution, developers exploring embedded AI in healthcare, and researchers working on bio-signal interpretation.

## 👨‍💻 Development Credits

This capstone project was developed by a team of four passionate Computer Engineering students. I served as the lead developer, overseeing both the hardware integration and software architecture—from sensor interfacing and ESP32 programming to mobile app development and machine learning model training. My three colleagues played key roles in building the mobile application, gathering and preparing the dataset, assembling the circuit, and documenting the development process, making GlucoPulse a truly collaborative and multidimensional effort.

ðŸ©º GlucoPulse: A Non-Invasive Glucometer
GlucoPulse is a next-generation, Arduino-based glucometer engineered for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. Built around the powerful ESP32 microcontroller, it seamlessly integrates hardware, cloud connectivity, and intelligent prediction models to deliver a user-friendly and data-driven health solution.

ðŸ”§ Core Features:

  Non-Invasive Sensing: Utilizes the MAX30102 pulse oximeter to capture photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals, enabling glucose estimation through light-based analysisâ€”no needles required.
  
  ESP32-Powered Architecture: Acts as the central CPU, orchestrating sensor data acquisition, preprocessing, and wireless communication with high efficiency.
  
  OLED Display Interface: Provides real-time feedback and intuitive visualization of glucose readings directly on-device, enhancing usability and accessibility.
  
  IoT Integration with Google Firebase: Enables secure cloud syncing, remote monitoring, and historical data tracking for both users and healthcare providers.
  
  ðŸ“± Mobile Application: A companion app offers personalized insights, trend analysis, and seamless interaction with the deviceâ€”bridging hardware and user experience.
  
  ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Intelligence: Trained on a curated dataset using polynomial regression, the system adapts to individual physiological patterns for increasingly accurate predictions over time.

ðŸ”¬ Applications: Perfect for diabetic patients seeking a pain-free monitoring solution, developers exploring embedded AI in healthcare, and researchers working on bio-signal interpretation.
